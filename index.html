Testing rest apis in Java is not as easy as in other interpreted languages like
Ruby or Python. rest-assured is an open source library that aims to make it simpler.

Rest-assured has a very permissive open source license that means anyone is free to use it and modify it as she pleases.

The library supports most of the prevalent authentication mechanisms as well as all Rest API methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH etc.
It also has simplistic methods for asserting for common http constructs like response status, body etc. It supports validating different response
formats. Asserting on JSON is very intuitive and easy to understand.

In the follow sections we'll see different aspects of rest assured.

First, to add rest-assured in our maven based project, we'll get the dependency from maven central. A quick Google search gives us this deendency.

<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.rest-assured/rest-assured -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest-assured</artifactId>
    <version>4.4.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

Based on when you are using this, you could look for a later version. Note, how we are using the scope as "test" since we only want this dependency in our tests.
